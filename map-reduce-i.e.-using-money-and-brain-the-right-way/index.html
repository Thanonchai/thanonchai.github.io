  <p>Have you been to a meeting where your key stakeholders, decision makers, or even
your managers look at you like this?</p>
<p><img src="/images/lookdown.jpg" alt="Lookdown"></p>
<p>As a technical person, I have been to many of these, more than I had ever wanted
to or wished for. It&rsquo;s pretty much the reaction that me and my team would get
when we try to push a new idea forward or even try something new.  Adding that
as a person coming from a third world country and being Asian, not getting a
good scolding is already considered lucky (I did personally get those more than
a fair share of it). Instead of saying our lives matter, I guess us Asians
want to be just the wallflowers and avoiding attention. We just couldn&rsquo;t handle
scoldings or confrontations very well. Yet we&rsquo;re encouraged to speak up :):):).</p>
<p>Throughout my 16 years of corporate life, I think I have finally figured out,
at least maybe partially, the patterns that these people have in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>They highly value brain power and time.</li>
<li>They are cursed by having too much money.</li>
<li>By default, they think you are stupid.</li>
<li>By default, they think vendors are geniuses.</li>
<li>They love to exercise power.</li>
<li>To them, efficiency includes laziness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not my problem.&rdquo; is how they meet their OKRs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll add more to the list once I&rsquo;ve figured out more. But at this point,
you may wonder while the rest are like a rant, point #1 seems to be &hellip; a good
thing. Some of you grown-ups would know that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions.</em>&rdquo; &ndash;
<strong>T.S. Eliot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s their time they value and their brain power to attend some meetings to make
some &ldquo;decisions&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything your time or your brain power.</p>
<h1 id="buy-vs-outsource-but-dont-you-dare-even-think-about-build">Buy vs Outsource but DON&rsquo;T YOU DARE even think about Build</h1>
<p>Recently an incident occurred, someone just rushed to a consulting company
to conduct a cold-eye review. It&rsquo;s kinda hilarious, surreal and bizarre to see
this very act in action &ndash; your higher-ups hired someone to interview you rather
than wanting to hear from you directly. You just got no chance to say anything
because all the observations above are just in play, plus it gives them a nice
bumper to blame the consulting firm when things go sideways (Not my problem,
eh?). Btw, sorry but your consulting report &hellip; sucks so much that without the
nice graphics I&rsquo;d have thought it was done by a highschooler. &ldquo;Fallback&rdquo;???
Urgh ggez bunch of noobs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the most recent &ldquo;Buy&rdquo;. Oh we look so smart when we do that,
checkbox ticked and it&rsquo;s green again.  We would sometimes look even smarter if
we can outsource some of these activities. Others will do it cheaper and better.
Just recently, on a group photo of senior architects, a comment was left saying
&ldquo;so much experience in solution selections!&rdquo;. Wow, didn&rsquo;t know that architects
are revered for their shopping sprees! Hopefully you know exactly what you&rsquo;re
trying to get.</p>
<p>Having too much money pretty much confines their thinking to be just Buy vs
Outsource. If these Buy activities are so admired, the opposite is also true &ndash;
it&rsquo;s a taboo and blasphemy to even think about Building. Oh and experiments are
also an act of building like Outsource to Buy. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll get
ridiculed.  If you&rsquo;re not, here is what you can yourself into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re gonna do this.  That&rsquo;s stupid and YOU are stupid. I&rsquo;m
wasting my time here and can&rsquo;t believe I was fooled into listening to you. Say
it that your idea is stupid or else I&rsquo;ll leave the room and tell the whole
world.&rdquo; &ndash; <strong>You know it&rsquo;s you if you&rsquo;re reading this. It was the room 3C.466
:)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from saliva sprayed onto my face and stinking acidic coffee breathes,
which could have been a major COVID risk factor now, hatred was so real almost
eating you alive.  To give more context, the person was comparing what my team
were doing vs a product from a giant ERP vendor. It&rsquo;s also an irony that the
person was (and I believe still is) suffering from severe reliability issues
while we wanted to offload some of that workload to cloud. I understand it well,
not buying IS stupid.</p>
<p><img src="/images/yourstupid.jpg" alt="Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m suffering!"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d contend that without a little bit of prototyping or building here and there,
you won&rsquo;t actually know much about what you&rsquo;re trying to do. Being vague is
never going to turn out well, except with pure hope and luck. Thinking that your
vendor will solve all the problems for you is like outsourcing your brain
while having to continue to be compensated in the same full amount.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see why I&rsquo;m stupid. Oh and yes to get out of that situation, I was
stupid enough to say &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo;. No matter how much that
guy wanted to discuss anything afterwards, I just avoided it completely.</p>
<h1 id="entering-map-reduce">Entering Map Reduce</h1>
<p>Sorry for the long intro, but IMHO it&rsquo;s really unhealthy, toxic or even
dangerous when every move and act is confined to Buy vs Build where the latter
is always a no-no. If we take a step back, we&rsquo;ll know that we miss the forest
for the trees. In the grand scheme of things, whether Buy vs Build vs Outsource
is a premature conclusion of problem solving. It&rsquo;s still perplexing to me what
people actually meant when they fill in their performance review form with
&ldquo;Problem Solving&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So if a problem arises where you have a lot of data, perhaps too much, to
process, what would you or your org do?  I&rsquo;d bet with my little whole month
worth of salary that here will be from mine:</p>
<p><img src="/images/brainlet.jpg" alt="Not a tech company!"></p>
<p>And then we will lose brain in the process. The funniest quote of the century
I&rsquo;ve seen so far was given by this senior technical fellow when asked about her
view around DevOps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know it yet because :-P (The ERP vendor) hasn&rsquo;t told us about it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there goes another millions and a good chunk of time spent hopefully the
pains and itches will go away. Eventually, something would come out, but rarely
they were worth the investment. Does it really mean that if we&rsquo;re not a tech
company, we can&rsquo;t do it like them or use our brain like them&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think
so.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how big brain people solved it. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1327452.1327492">Map
Reduce</a>
is a paper published to ACM more than a decade ago. It&rsquo;s the way Google tackled
this exact same problem - too much data to process. Yes, they needed it because
they were indexing the whole internet to give you as much accurate search
result as possible (and now they&rsquo;re indexing your lives too just PSA).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oi! A paper? You&rsquo;re being academic again! I&rsquo;m outta here.&rdquo;. I know I know here
is the suggestion I&rsquo;d give - maybe you should do yourself a favor and attach C4
bombs to all your Hadoop and Spark clusters before handing me the remote
control.  I promise I&rsquo;ll gently hit the button like how I touch a baby&rsquo;s
buttcheeks with a pinch of talcum. For these people, there&rsquo;s a saying probably
in Japanese that they should smash their head into tofu until they die. It&rsquo;ll
take a while, but you&rsquo;ll get to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanzu_River">Sanzu
River</a> eventually.</p>
<p>Map Reduce is the quintessential of problem solving using both brains and money.
While reading it, you can&rsquo;t help but be impressed how they elegantly tacked the
problem and this was in 2004 when computing resources were so scarce. Perhaps
some of your phones these days are more powerful than some of their servers.
However, they were able to process 1TB of data within easily within 1000
seconds, something many are still struggling with today.</p>
<p>The secret sauce? Simple, using brains to create value from something cheap.
It&rsquo;s almost always the theme of these papers. For Map Reduce, it&rsquo;s creating a
fleet of cheap, commodity machines that would coordinate with each other to
process a gigantic amount of data (i.e. all the web pages) if the task can be
sequenced into the map and reduce steps. If anything fails, something will pick
it up. No manual monitoring, no human intervention, no nonsense that will be
required to squeeze more efficiency by outsourcing it some other countries
later. Yeah they&rsquo;ve got money, but they will buy their servers cheap. They even
got to the point that they bought grade B memory (need to find source, but I
could remember it was an ACM talk) and started in-memory computing before
anyone. They rather buy to acquire more power than just to solve a problem. And
that&rsquo;s been making them stay above others, by using brains and not having to do
much with being a tech company.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weee.jpg" alt="Weeeeeeee"></p>
<p>Those who have done functional programming would be very well familiar with the
Map Reduce model. I suspect that the popularity of Map Reduce may be the reason
why most languages now support functional paradigm. For those who are not, a Map
step does what its name suggests - mapping from something to another. That
something is usually a key value pair (e.g. a website url as the key and its
content as the value). A map step can be used for filtering as well. And you can
have a sequence of multiple map steps, like multiple Mario pipes attached to
each other. A reduce step does the final calculation from the input (e.g. group
and count the occurrence of a word).</p>
<p>The beauty of this model is that both Map and Reduce steps can be distributed to
many workers. They can be repeated as many times as you want as long as you keep
them deterministic. Remember that deterministic function you learned in
highschool? They are the same thing - the output of a function is determined
solely by the input. For those of you from the House of API Haute Couture, it&rsquo;s
kinda <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40296211/what-is-the-difference-between-an-idempotent-and-a-deterministic-function">like but not the really same as your
idempotency</a>
The premise is that if you call them with the same inputs, they will produce the
same results.</p>
<p>So what can you with this? Because their results will be same, you can basically
run them anywhere, and you can run them as many as you want as long as you have
a machine for them. And because of that, you can buy a lot of cheap machines and
distribute them to those machine. And if any of them fails, the rest can pick up
easily, you just need to coordinate them. And no, you don&rsquo;t need human to
constantly monitor and coordinate (*cough *cough like a &hellip;. Bat&amp;&amp; team) to
later outsource them to gain efficiency, you automated them.  They built
something to automatically coordinate the work and reassign tasks in case of
failures. That something piece is called the Master.</p>
<p>Here is a photo hunt game for you, please find the differences between these
pictures:
<img src="/images/mapreduce.png" alt="Map Reduce"></p>
<p><img src="/images/bigbrain.jpg" alt="Big Brain"></p>
<p><strong>Game over.  You can&rsquo;t!  That&rsquo;s it.</strong></p>
<h1 id="map-reduce-seems-cool-so-what">Map Reduce seems cool.. So what?</h1>
<p>The paper already summarizes pretty much all the benefits, but here I will
highlight the points I particularly like.</p>
<p>First, there are certain differences between a pet project and a systematic
approach in trying to solve a problem.  The first attempts to achieve the state
of being cool, while the latter details as much as possible to problem being
solved. Throughout the Map Reduce paper, you can clearly see the detailed
limitations and resources they were equipped with. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of
what Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt mention in their book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not whether you think inside the box or outside the box. The problem lies
in <strong>finding</strong> the box - identifying real constraints.&rdquo; &ndash; <strong>Dave Thomas and Andy
Hunt</strong>, The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the proposed programming model is a prime example of great separation
of concerns in practice. Map Reduce programmers can focus on their map and
reduce functions, keep them simple and ensure they are correct. They don&rsquo;t have
to worry about how to make them run in parallel as the framework will handle it
for them. The operators of the cluster can just focus on resource allocation and
observe how the system performs.</p>
<p>Lastly, and I love this one most, how it uses redundancy to deal with
stragglers. <em>A straggler is a machine or process that takes an unsually long time
to complete one of the last few tasks in the computation.</em> There can be so many
reasons why stragglers occur, but instead of focusing on finding the rootcause
for each of them, the Master assigns a backup job to other worker(s). If the
backup finishes first, it doesn&rsquo;t have to care about the straggler anymore.
Redundancy may sound like a taboo for some people, but they were able to achieve
44% increase in terms of performance. It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re slow, I&rsquo;m gonna send
in Usain Bolt.</p>
<p>Think about it, the same approach can be used for not just computing, but how
your organization can achieve its goals as well. Gregor Hohpe refers to this as
The <strong>Economy of Speed</strong>. In that type of economy, there&rsquo;s no reason why there
must be just one group responsible for a task. If they&rsquo;re in your way, you can
find a Usain Bolt to get the value to the customer without waiting for the
authorative group to come back to you. IIRC, Mike Amundsen said in one of the
podcast episode that Amazon has many of the same things because of no wait
policy as well.</p>
<p><img src="/images/straggler.jpg" alt="Stragglers"></p>
<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>
<p>I hope by now I was able to convince you that problem solving has something to
do with using brains and money the right way than just being recognized by other
as a tech company. If you don&rsquo;t, then please at least don&rsquo;t discourage others
who aspire to. Sometimes these tech companies you don&rsquo;t want to become resort to
using a number of primitive approaches than you might think (like pingging and
piggy backing).</p>
<p>Finally, Map Reduce is how Google solved this data processing problem <strong>back in
2004</strong>. In 2014, they announced <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/06/25/google-dumps-mapreduce-favor-new-hyper-scale-analytics-system">they no longer use the
technique</a>.
The paper did become a classic on how to use brains and money the right way. And
the news basically gave us a good reminder that if you&rsquo;re still struggling with
the same problem they had in the past, the future doesn&rsquo;t really bode well for
you (plus, they have a much better way of indexing your lives too).</p>
