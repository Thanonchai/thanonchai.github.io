<p>I was inspired to have a blog for a while now.  But in the process I also wanted to
personalize it by not being bound by a certain internet platform.  I like the idea of freedom
and have been tired of certain restraints, that&rsquo;s why I chose to do it this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also found it a bit boring if I have to start it with a typical Hello World kind of
post.  I found the quote to be more powerful, while also a good sign of starting strong.
You have no idea how I have been wanting to write (or type) it LOL.</p>
