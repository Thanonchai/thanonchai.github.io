      <description>Have you been to a meeting where your key stakeholders, decision makers, or even your managers look at you like this?
As a technical person, I have been to many of these, more than I had ever wanted to or wished for. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the reaction that me and my team would get when we try to push a new idea forward or even try something new. Adding that as a person coming from a third world country and being Asian, not getting a good scolding is already considered lucky (I did personally get those more than a fair share of it).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; — John 1: 1-14 KJV I was inspired to have a blog for a while now. But in the process I also wanted to personalize it by not being bound by a certain internet platform. I like the idea of freedom and have been tired of certain restraints, that&amp;rsquo;s why I chose to do it this way.</description>
