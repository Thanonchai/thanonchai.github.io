  <p>Me and my friends often joke that we&rsquo;re in a bit of nationality, if not identity
crisis.  Many of us are from Chinese families, born into Thailand, with morality
shaped by weekend Japanese cartoons and with our brains quite Hollywoodized.
Sometimes we can&rsquo;t even tell what motives are driving us to believe and behave
in a certain way. It&rsquo;s kinda a conversation guaranteed to come up a booze and
weed smoking party.</p>
<p>And for the record, I don&rsquo;t do weeds or alcohols.  The only weeds I consume are
different kinds of green tea.  Somehow it became a joke that what you order in a
bar determined how high of morality you had.  My memorized answer had always
been &ldquo;Milk&rdquo;, and with that you can judge how creative your friends are based on
their response. On one end of the spectrum, you have those with a twisted facial
expression &ndash; &ldquo;You&hellip; seriously? For someone like you? I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;, &ldquo;What
are you, a baptized monk?&rdquo;.  One the other end, it can get very very nasty -
&ldquo;Sure, do you want it in a glass or in a human organ?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you still
want a straw?&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/milk.jpg" alt="milk"></p>
<p>Apart from Morality, the other topic guaranteed to come up is Freedom and
Oppression. I still remember the conversation about how our parents had been
brought up, the hardships they had faced and why they had really really wanted
us to learn Chinese.  They didn&rsquo;t tell us much the details how all the Chinese
schools were completely eradicated from the society.  It was not that they saw
China would rise to power like today and suddenly their kids could do
better, after all this was pretty much around the second half of the 80s.  At
that time, my grandma was still sending money back to her hometown in Jie-Yang.
Lives in Thailand were considered much more well to do than where she came from.
If you need to reuse all kinds of excretion for growing food, you know that
you&rsquo;re living in some kind of a hell.</p>
<p>Looking back in hindsight, making sure that kids know Chinese was more about the
determination to not let their traditions and beliefs disintegrate into
oblivion, plus as a way to get back at the society who used to ridiculed them.
It was more to teach you must know who you are and where you are from than a fad
or win big in business. Well, the latter is actually a hidden agenda as Chinese
would be more &ldquo;家己人&rdquo; towards Chinese.  The more they can tell you&rsquo;re
Chinese, the better impression you&rsquo;ll have on them. Knowing Chinese sets you
apart from those with a Chinese appearance.  Anyway, it was more as to teaching
the pride, principles and cultures than business.  Lives are short, but any
carvings designed onto people&rsquo;s heart live long. Time has already proven how
strong these ideas come to life and thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh&hellip; you enrolled in a Japanese course?  I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re learning more stuff
but it could have been Chinese&hellip;&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Lim Sai Keng</strong>, my beloved grandma, the kindest person I will only ever
meet again in the afterlife.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="and-any-cultures-also-live-long-while-peasants-are-the-ones-who-suffer">And&hellip;, any cultures also live long, while peasants are the ones who suffer</h1>
<p>Classic disclaimers in any school history classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the vast amount of information, not everything is accurate.</li>
<li>History is written by the winners (yep super common anecdotal).</li>
<li>Some history is more important others.</li>
<li>History is bound to repeat itself.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you never study history, you might be monocularly blind.  However, if you
never questioned any history you studied, you&rsquo;re completely blind.&rdquo; &ndash;
<strong>Charnvit Kasetsiri</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/nanjing.jpg" alt="Nanjing Massacre"></p>
<p>From many personal conversations and experience, I can conclude a bit,
inaccurately of course, that westerners don&rsquo;t have much grasp on the history of
the Far Easterns', but the opposite is actually true - those from Asian
countries do know a good deal of what happened in the Western World during the
last century. The prime example of this is the victims of the WWII - we have a
good idea of what happened to Jewish. However, not many people on the West side
of the world know about this event called <em>the Nanjing Massacre</em>. I need to warn
you that you should not go willy nilly and look it up as it can make you
depressed for days, if not weeks. The things that happened to these people were
to me an absolute horror, to the point that any Hollywood horror movies have
never fantasized anything near it. It&rsquo;s one of those moments that make you doubt
if god exists or if there&rsquo;s any hope in humanity left.</p>
<p>Regardless of what and where these things happened, history teaches us that it&rsquo;s
always been fears and terrors people use as the main tool to oppress the other
side in order to control them. What may not be recorded so much is this is how
fear has been engineered and employed, and operated at what level. We may see
fears mostly at best at the macro level, but it&rsquo;s been not so well recorded, or
even understood at the micro level. And to the best of my humble opinions and
limited knowledge, the reasons have always been:</p>
<ul>
<li>The victims at that level were mostly too illiterate to be able to write
anything about it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>The victims accepted that fears were the norms.</li>
<li>The victims were not heard by anyone, let alone any ounce of justice spared
for them.</li>
<li>The victims were not fortunate enough to live through and told what happened.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last century started somewhat hellishly, but ended miraculously. What
miracles, you ask?  It&rsquo;s sudden acceptance of many ideas, which we had regarded
as norms for centuries, that they are wrong.  Count it, how many years since
Jesus Christ and the Buddha left this world and we finally were enlightened
enough to be able to say &ldquo;Yeah slavery is not right.&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Women are actually
not men&rsquo;s properties and they are as capable if not more in some scenarios&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be right that one race is better than others&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Competitions bring
progresses&rdquo;, you name it.  It is now kinda cool to know that Bob Marley smoked
weeds and sang <em>Redemption Song</em>!  But by looking back at it, I think cultures
have been cruel to mankind as a whole and these cruelties have lived so long if
not too long, only it was relooked at seriously with many different reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sad that those cruelties only inflict upon <em>Those Who Work</em> mostly
one-sidedly even up to now. And it&rsquo;s simply because cruelties breed fears, and
fears bring about control, fears are usually baked into the most cultures.
Cultures are something carved into the stone and hearts of the people.  Once
they&rsquo;re there, you almost stand no chance to change them, let alone the idea of
ridding of them. The worst worlds you can possibly live in are the worlds where
their cultures tolerate terrors and treat fears as norms.  Aren&rsquo;t those the main
ingredients of dystopias in all the movies?</p>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/whipping.png" alt="Whipping"></p>
<h1 id="wth-are-corporate-gestapos">WTH are Corporate Gestapos?</h1>
<p>So let me ask you this question, and I know it&rsquo;s so controversial, but bear with
me a bit here&hellip;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Weren&rsquo;t the Nazis and the Japanese in Nanjing trying to create a better
world?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way&hellip; I&rsquo;d say yeah. It&rsquo;s just that their perfect worlds didn&rsquo;t have Jewish
people or non-Japanese people. To them, these victims weren&rsquo;t human if not
diseases they must eradicate from this planet. It&rsquo;s exactly like they said:
<em>&ldquo;Hell is full of good meanings.&quot;</em>. I guess only time will be able to tell if
your good intentions sent people to hell and (hopefully) back alive or not. By
that time, those people can even tell what lives mean and if god ever exists.</p>
<p>But here is what I think is interesting about fears: These people feared the
existence of these &ldquo;impurities&rdquo; enough to the point that to them the world was
no longer a habitable place if they both were left to coexist. And in order to
eradicate the things they feared, they bred and instilled more fears into their
people to help them in their eradicative missions. Then people instilled with
fears feared the first group enough to use whatever measures and methods to
carry out <em>&ldquo;The Mission&rdquo;</em>. Then the controlling group also feared that the people
seemingly in control may start being rebellious and they could trust no one, so
more fears were hence introduced as part of controls. This became quite vicious
cycles, continuing indefinitely until some interventions, until the extinction
of the other side, or worse the original idea/definition of impurities evolved and
more eradicative missions were planned then carried out. If we&rsquo;re lucky, someone
would record something about it as part of history. And many of us who took the
red pill know that the aftermath has been a&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Nazis created a terror-state. This was achieved through intimidation and
brutality. Those living in Germany were too scared to disobey Nazi laws.&quot;</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And one of the most effective unit of this terror state is the Gestapos and
their informants.  They were the agents of fears and those recruited by the
agents.  These <em>secret police</em>&rsquo;s main job was to search and report any
rebellious feelings towards the Nazi party. They installed terror by instilling
fears through the cracks of people and society. They created the pervasive
impression of someone was actively watching you if you behaved the way you were
supposed to be <em>controlled</em>, hence security of the state. Of course if you wage
a war with your own people, you create fears as widespread as possible. You
divide and conquer them, and nothing beats turning them against each other.</p>
<p>And you can see this very similar model in many settings not just what the Nazis
did to the Jewish and Germans who were not in concert with The Nazis. Domestic
violence, school bullying, workplace predators have some resemblance to these
exhibits of the Nazis, and many times these apparently unwanted behaviors are
sustained by the people who are willing to assume the role of <em>Gestapo</em>. They
can aid in reporting events to the ringleaders, engaging in public shaming or
condemning activities, collectively distorting facts by means of FUD (i.e.
Gaslighting). Oh of course they love you they will tell. They want to lower your
self-esteem enough that you can&rsquo;t live without them and have no choice but
accept the only love you think you deserve.</p>
<p>(Ok, at this point many of you my friends may start to think if this is what
Koi&rsquo;s treating me.  Of course not in a million years.  She loves me and I love
her. No domestic violence and no non-sense stuff are going on.  She smacks my
head sometimes when I don&rsquo;t behave and that&rsquo;s all.  And yes, I&rsquo;m not being
forced to type this in with her standing behind me.  If you wanna help, kindly
ask her to sing to me more as I can count them with my bare hands how many
times she has sung for me, especially this month it&rsquo;s our 10th year anniversary.
&lt;3)</p>
<p>The depressing part is this is so common even in our contemporary corporate work
environment. Aspiring fresh graduates would think this was already 21st century
there would be no such barbaric things anymore, but boy oh boy how naive and
ignorant they were. They are being spied and reported back about their behaviors
and attitudes starting from the very first day of them stepping into the
their workplace, the corporate they hope they could bring some values to the
table, their moral beliefs of the right things, their passion to change things
for good as it may very well be their new place to spend the majority of time in
a day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at that moment, the eyes of many corporate gestapos are laid on
them.  The eyes expect to see them immediately <em>blend in</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/4nmj3r.jpg" alt="The Eye of Sauron"></p>
<p>Again, I guess it&rsquo;s been more than a few times that I&rsquo;ve repeated this type of
line - <em>&ldquo;Hell is full good meanings and wishings&rdquo;</em>. If you look at a company&rsquo;s
policies, they&rsquo;re all good intentions there. They often represent what the
company values, hence their importance. It&rsquo;s an absolute, non-negotiable must
that they&rsquo;re held high at all time. Anyone is no-hire if the person has a chance
to compromise the policies, i.e. the values.</p>
<p>But how a company goes about implementing these policies is another story. This
is especially true in the realm of security, at least in my limited experience
and interpretation of the world.  People go about implementing something based
on fears because it is the easiest way.  It also happens to be most
effective because it&rsquo;s naturally ingrained in the area closer to the spinal
cord of any human brain. This rudimentary property makes it resonate well with
anybody, whether the person is of a developed or undeveloped mind.</p>
<p>In the Southeast Asian part of the world, there seems a common playbook being
repeated over and over in the last century.  Whether is Burma (now Myanmar),
Siam (now Thailand), Khmer (now Cambodia), the Philippines, Indonesia, they were
competing (and some still are) to achieve the new low by establishing an Olympic
game of Military Coups. From the news, the latest gold medal goes to Myanmar
apparently, while Thailand is still on point to win the silver medal after
shockingly and instantaneously beat by its neighbor at last minute. Ironically,
the main job of the organizers have always been keeping their country secure. I
can only guess that this is when you give all the artillery to the security
guards and all they can think of is to make you fear them and not the Win-Win
mindset bs.  When their viewpoint of security is different than you, you&rsquo;re
kinda doomed.  There you goes another point to support the second amendment and
rights to own guns.  You just don&rsquo;t know when these people who&rsquo;re supposed to
protect you, the national security guards, will turn against you with the arms
and armors on your dime.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/famine.jpg" alt="Ok Boomer"></p>
<p>Ok, enough with foreign politics. But try to relate that with how corporates go
about implementing security. I&rsquo;ve not been with many companies, but what I&rsquo;ve
seen has been basically <em>&ldquo;Security is one of the most important thing.&quot;</em> and
<em>&ldquo;We need to have controls.&quot;</em>. People start feeling uncomfortable with gaps,
i.e. no controls. But wait, most of the time it&rsquo;s more of <em>no controls
implemented like I want</em> than really literally no control. So the maturity of
controls they can come up with is capped to what the person with the discomfort
knows, and no way beyond that.  It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t dream of Africa if you
haven&rsquo;t heard of Africa. And generally corporates are cursed by this because of
cost constraints or efficiency, they have a dedicate department for Security,
monopolizing the ability to provide Controls. If it&rsquo;s not blessed by us, it&rsquo;s
not any good.  When people especially new joiners hear about it, they would
think this is like a tyranny from the middle ages declaring <em>I&rsquo;m the laws</em>.</p>

<p>Another day in paradise (or Limbo?). Who&rsquo;s actually supposed to keep up with
technology, not everyone?  You already lost all the respect when you said
<em>AuthPing</em> LOL. These are some examples of just the <strong>Corporate Gestapos</strong>.  You
can do a reality check if you are one of them by seeing if someone is having a
panic attack when you try to reach out to the person.  Why the panic? It&rsquo;s from
the inability to question the authorities. Ding Ding Ding, we&rsquo;re from the
bureau, anything I say and you say is not recorded, and if you don&rsquo;t want to be
sent to the gas chamber, don&rsquo;t act like my previous boss.</p>
<p>And the Gestapos' <strong>Informants</strong> are not any better, and I&rsquo;d go so far to say
they&rsquo;re even worse. Didn&rsquo;t Anne Frank meet her miserable end because of the
informants (crap, did I just spoil it?)? These companies would invest a good
deal of money and have people attend some <em>mandatory</em> training. The word
actually highlights the intention - you have some consequences for not
attending.  Security is everyone&rsquo;s business, everyone must be vigilant. That
right there gives a license for anybody to turn against others in the name of
security. That right there makes people bring stupid questions about security
every now and then because of <em>Trust but Verify</em> But if I can find your <em>bad
stuff</em>, I&rsquo;ve got something to write on my yearly performance review form. Yayyy.
Let&rsquo;s call it instead <em>Poorman&rsquo;s Manual Zero Trust</em> shall we? We won&rsquo;t
be able to get to <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/">Google&rsquo;s Zero Trust</a>
level anyway since we&rsquo;re not a tech company.  Instead let&rsquo;s train our people
to use less of their brain and use their eyes to observe and inform more.  Meet
your corporate&rsquo;s role model, employee of the century, big-eyed Wojak.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/wojak.png" alt="Corporate Wojak"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also funny because instead of measuring what actually matters objectively,
only how many people comply with the act is mainly measured. Oh and don&rsquo;t tell
me it&rsquo;s also measuring via those mock phishing emails; that is a theater in the
first place. Since it went live, I have not been on any team where the
supervisor wouldn&rsquo;t send a &ldquo;warning&rdquo; email to the team that there&rsquo;s one coming
today!!!. And isn&rsquo;t phishing about social engineering conning you for sensitive
information, how come is it now about just clicking a link? Yet, the amount of
fear being put into this is more than a healthy dose by any means.  You&rsquo;re
merely measuring fears in the first place.  And what did you get back from these
exercise? Pervasive paranoia and massive corporate thanatophobia.</p>
<p>Here is a real story, and it just happened last year. An ex-member, very tech
savvy and cult hero of my team, started writing a tech blog for my company. That
was a really good one and drew a lot of interest from tech talents from
both outside and inside the company wanting to join my team. But suddenly,
things just went downhill. He got a lot of repercussions because of that post.
What happened is just beyond nonsense, something that makes you want to holler
&ldquo;WTF?&rdquo;. A <em>friend</em> on FB (as you know, ironically not really a friend)
questioned him <em>&ldquo;Is this allowed? It&rsquo;s got an IP?&quot;</em> (welp, don&rsquo;t you know there&rsquo;s
this thing called NAT?). A manager called him asking why posting without
checking. Worst, the law department wanted to see if they needed to <em>&ldquo;take any
actions&rdquo;</em>. What are you going to send him to the gas chamber? As an IT manager,
weren&rsquo;t you supposed to read and understand the content before any ounce of
judgment? Why is it on him to be interrogated and explaining every single step
he walked?</p>
<p>I want to ask you a bit of favor to put yourself in this guy&rsquo;s shoes a bit.
First, the thing he was writing is something you put on a job posting, he just
made it clearer. That&rsquo;s how companies these days attract technical talents.
Secondly, the amount of people he could go geek out about the work he was
passionate was so lowwww. He was just sending a message to promote some of these
stuff culturally and it&rsquo;s not in anybody&rsquo;s attention at all unlike TOGAF or SAFe
where everyone was so Gung ho about (as a teaser, that topic is coming after the
next entry). Doing a good job is such a hard thing because these gestapos and
their informants would just hunt you down. And lastly, he was doing us a favor.
How, you asked? Because he intentionally didn&rsquo;t write anything bad about his
company at all (unlike what I&rsquo;m doing now LOL). He was suffering mentally, but
he was decent enough to do it the way he did, yet the majority didn&rsquo;t appreciate
it. He told me this before leaving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah I omitted those bad parts altogether. It sucks so much having to raise
tickets for getting a software. It sucks so much having to wait for a new PI to
get something done even some simple thing like integrating datapup to my cloud
component. It also terrifies me so much to see &lsquo;Popcorn&rsquo; (his previous boss)
being sent to Gulag because he was trying to have more productivity to his team.
Writing about them doesn&rsquo;t help getting the kind of good attention or excitement
I wanted. But now I don&rsquo;t know what I can save you guys from. There&rsquo;s no future
here. I now feel bad because it lures people into a jail cell and I was the one
shouting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB58mKol0kY">いらっしゃいませ！</a>
welcoming them to hell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/irsh.gif" alt="welcome!"></p>
<p>To what end?? When will this insanity be over?? It&rsquo;s undeniably a downward
spiral. Up to now, we&rsquo;re still unable to backfill him with the quality he used
to deliver for us, even though the proposed compensation we want to give to any
replacement is now at 4 times of what used to pay him. And no, we had actually
never spent $$$$ to train him up, it&rsquo;s the reverse of the Pareto&rsquo;s, less than
20% was spent for him, but we had taken for grant for the 80% of his capability
and had been reaping on his talents. But the treatment that he and the likes of
him from these Corporate Gestapos and their Informants felt like they were
merely plagues and germs.  They are the antagonists with evil plans that these
security guards, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers must come to
eliminate and save the world.  There must be no villains.</p>
<p>But like how Alan Moore puts it in one of his masterpiece comic to date, <em><strong>&ldquo;Who
Watches the Watchmen&rdquo;</strong></em>. Sorry for the disrespect Marvel fans, but who watches
Iron Man, Captain America or Wolverine when they turn against their powerless
people (Capcom? Nah, your remakes suck). Are we just germs and vermin that must
be exterminated from the earth because we don&rsquo;t think alike? I guess not, but
unlike Auschwitz, people can choose to leave if they feel unhappy enough. And I
guess you&rsquo;re quite a hard time dealing with many talents leaving you already.
In fact, if they&rsquo;re too troubled by bumping head into your Auschwitzian
Guardians of Galaxy all the time, their mission in the new workplace will be to
make sure your workplace reputation is ruined and you have no way to stop them.</p>

<h1 id="because-germs-are-our-gods">Because germs are our gods</h1>
<p>In the old days, when people got sick, they prayed to god. When they recovered,
they thanked god. But little did they know that it was actually their microbes,
the bacteria and viruses. God is all around us while you can&rsquo;t see god, so are
germs, bacteria and viruses. Maybe they are gods of destruction like COVID19, of
creation like Lactobacillus in your cup of yogurt. They can be found in many
antidotes and vaccines. In the case of bacteria, some forms of them were your
ancestors, perhaps before Adam and Eve. And perhaps, bacteria are your gods all
along.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>You get stronger when you live harmoniously with them. Without the right
balance, you get sick.  Too much bacteria in your stomach, you get diarrhea. Too
little of them, you become food intolerant. Everything is about having the
right balance may say, but when talking about germs people just want to
eliminate them altogether, especially in this pandemic. The idea of using
disinfectants to kill 99.9% germs is omnipresent and a must-have on some
products, while the opposite is unpleasant if not disgusting. The first time I told my
wife about this <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/book-showering/">book by James
Hamblin</a> who has stopped
showering 6 years ago, she said she wanted a divorce if I&rsquo;d ever attempt doing such
thing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corp-gestapos/clean.jpg" alt="clean"></p>
<h1 id="its-no-point-and-even-futile-to-completely-remove-germs-in-the-it-world">It&rsquo;s no point and even futile to completely remove germs in the IT world</h1>
<p>Instead, you live with and understand them better. 4 years ago when DevOps was
still such a big thing in my company, there were groups of people who equated
the movement with Netflix&rsquo;s Chaos Monkey. That was so lame and I didn&rsquo;t agree
with those people one bit. However, the idea of playing with fire in Production
has captivated me until this very day (I&rsquo;m a big fan of Casey Rosenthal! Go
watch all his talks, they&rsquo;re all brilliant!). Of course, I want to sometimes
burn down Production, not because of my grudges, but it&rsquo;s so complex beyond
anybody&rsquo;s grasp. The Chaos Monkey initiative later evolved into Intuition
Engineering (now Observability?), and then Chaos Engineering. The antithesis of
Chaos Engineering, unpopular and perhaps a blasphemy to many corporate IT
managers, is by injecting faults into a running system will allow you to
understand and be proactive about what you can do with the soooo complex system
you may have. And the catch is it&rsquo;s gonna be better if it&rsquo;s a running production
system than your lower environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I love production, YOU should love production. You should go as early and
often as possible. Bring the kids. Bring the family. The weather&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s
better than Disneyland!&rdquo; &ndash; <strong>Josh Long</strong>, Spring Developer Advocate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And same thing goes for Chaos Engineering, let them eat cakes and let&rsquo;s have
some chaos in Production baby. But let&rsquo;s admit it, we&rsquo;re not ready yet.  I
personally have told that idea to some IT managers, and the looks from those
people were like I just threw some processed fibers full of e-coli germs on
their faces&hellip; &ldquo;Did I just tell some interesting IT Physics?&rdquo;. &ldquo;No, what you
just spat it&rsquo;s feces, they are now all over my face.&rdquo; Ummm take it or leave it
but even many non-tech companies are now looking at this concept seriously. It&rsquo;s
the same idea as taking vaccine - by injecting germs, you body learns to fight
germs better. By injecting faults, we now understand the failure modes better
and we spend less time and money to worry about Disaster Recovery because we&rsquo;re
confident that it works. It&rsquo;s risky, but it can be controlled if you follow the
<a href="https://principlesofchaos.org/">principles</a> carefully. Some of these companies
removed the DR process and the need to rehearse altogether. To them, DR is so
much like praying to god to cure for your illness but refusing a Polio shot. The
result is usually a deformed, crippled IT department.</p>
<p>One strange thing I found is to many companies, Safety is of utmost importance.
Anything that may compromise physical safety, even the slight chance for near
miss, it will be dealt with right away. People must be safe. That&rsquo;s an honorary
commitment.</p>
<p>But when it comes to safety in the virtual environments, things are almost
turned upside down. It&rsquo;s no longer included in their mission to provide a safe
environment. Instead, it&rsquo;s more on that people can&rsquo;t be trusted and these
developers are the children of Satan born to this world to create the full state
of anarchy (i.e.  hackerz). Their beliefs are like germs and filths that must be
eradicated. They must be controlled, and we are the Guardians of the Galaxy who
would bring ultimate peace. If a flat network allows anybody to reach the
production systems, the focus is no longer about fixing the environments, but to
torment people with fears and handcuffs. You&rsquo;ll be fired if you do this. You&rsquo;re
stupid if you call the app too many times. You have no brain to operate in this
environment. To other companies who have enlightened, they have safety parity of
both the physical and virtual world. If we accidentally put a sharp object in a
walk way, its our fault and we need to do something about it because it&rsquo;s not
safe. If the IT landscape is error-prone and vulnerable, its our fault and we
need to fix it because it&rsquo;s not safe and it&rsquo;s not fair to burden everyone with
company&rsquo;s tribal knowledge. What&rsquo;s more depressing is, instead of admitting the
problem, these companies are proud of their dangerous environments because they
make them <em>&ldquo;special&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Things that work at Google or Facebook will never work for us because they
don&rsquo;t have these special security requirements like we do.&quot;</em> &ndash; something of
smallbrained I heard recently. Technical debts don&rsquo;t make you special and the
compound interests will eat you alive. Not only that, no one good is going to come
and work for you because you just don&rsquo;t get it. And don&rsquo;t dream of having a
digital garage if you don&rsquo;t get it.  Last time I checked, most corporates'
garage looked withered and lifeless. Here is a glimpse of the general
perception about it. 4 years ago a guy posted on Reddit saying he had
accidentally destroyed production database on his first day. He was fired and
may be sued. The most voted responses couldn&rsquo;t be better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but if a junior dev can blow away your prod database by running a
script on his <em>local</em> dev environment while following your documentation, you
have no one to blame but yourself. Why is your prod database even reachable from
his local env? What does the rest of your security look like? Swiss cheese I
bet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What was their tech stack, <em>Jenga?</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And back to the futility of treating devs like germs. I hope by now I convinced
some of you that, but if by any chance I may have not, it&rsquo;s still good because
whether you like it or not, you still live with germs and your house may still
be full of roaches. Even though you don&rsquo;t want to admit it, they outsmart you
and they go through all the cracks you may have. And because they&rsquo;re innately
highly adaptable, they will survive much much longer than you do. Whatever
structures and controls you put in, you can only hope that they are effective.
And as we all know, hope is not a strategy. And let&rsquo;s face it, controls are
illusions, you just want to hear people say what you want to hear. As long as
you hear it, you&rsquo;re relieved and can sleep well at night.</p>

<h1 id="dont-bring-me-problems-bring-me-solutions">Don&rsquo;t bring me problems, bring me solutions</h1>
<p>I know this write-up would be just another long whining to somebody if it
doesn&rsquo;t offer any solutions. LOL and I got worked up a bit when thinking about
that. Sorry, but I will say this - <em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring me problems, bring me
solutions&rdquo;</em> in my experience is mostly a management retort aiming to push away
people who come to them to ask for help. Gees man, many technical people didn&rsquo;t
want to come to you management in the first place as they prefer to solve their
problems without talking to anyone. When they have problems they want to talk to
you, it&rsquo;s usually beyond what they can do.  And if they have too many of them,
either they&rsquo;re helpless, which is part of your job as part of performance
review; or they&rsquo;re hapless being in a super-complex environment full of bullies.
It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be just me thinking about this either <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be honest about it, if people come to you with just solutions, how
likely you&rsquo;ll like the ideas. I guess not a chance guys and girls, you will show
them &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the boss around here?&rdquo;. I preach too much and I&rsquo;m not even a
management myself, but maybe give habit 5 another try - <em>Seek first to
understand, then to be understood</em>. You need a bit of a context to be able to
understand anyway. They come to whine to you is still better than they go to
whine to a competitor.  Last I heard is they&rsquo;re also recruiting IT talents
heavily.</p>
<p>Anyway I promised that I&rsquo;ll give what I think they may help. They&rsquo;re my 2 cents,
so you can take them or leave them it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<h2 id="values-with-principles">Values with Principles</h2>
<p>Leaders set visions, Managers execute. The missing link is always HOWWWWWWWWWWW.
You can have another great leader of the century who wants to create a better
world and it could result in another Auschwitz or Nanjing (I&rsquo;m looking at you
Mr.Musk after you bought those bitcoins). Here is a twisted syllogism for you
living in this twisted world:</p>
<p><em>Everyone likes pizzas.</em><br>
<em>There is this pizza topping called Supreme.</em> <br>
<em>Hence, everyone is innately a supremacist.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa9cd1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3528x2113+0+0/resize/840x503!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F87%2Fdb%2F9dbdd8454ba8a49fc3cdd904b3b0%2Fvf-supreme-acquisition-17606.jpg" alt="SupremeLogo"></p>
<p>The answer, I believe, lies in also defining and communicating the principles
for the values. As a human, we lose track all the time of WHY we are doing
something in the first place.  Why did we need a safe environment? Because we&rsquo;re
want our people to risk their lives doing their job for the company. Why did we
want to have a secure environment? Because many of you are going to lose your
jobs if a breach makes tomorrow headline news. Indeed, these are naive whys, but
that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is by understanding the WHY, you can define HOW
much much better like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because we value everyone&rsquo;s safety both physically and mentally, we prohibit
any forms of blames on a person. While we do realize humans can sometimes be a
factor leading to an incident, only facts will be gathered mainly to remove the
human element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That may be the worst possible way to paraphrase Etsy&rsquo;s <em>Blameless Postmortems</em>.
Anyone reading some <em>DeafOops</em> stuff could come up with that too, but if you
peel the shallow layer out, you can see that there&rsquo;s both values/goals (Learning
from Mistakes) and principles (While also giving people Justice they need) in
play here. Another view is they want to work with facts (value/goal/policy), but
they want to make sure the facts are not distorted, dramatized, monopolized or
withheld due to the possibility of retribution, the only unacceptable failures
are failures to speak out (principle). Values without principles lead to
Auschwitz &ndash; you can become just a bean-counter watching some KPIs go up, but
you don&rsquo;t know if those KPIs might mean more death to the Jews. On the other
hand, principles without values make you lost by just going through the motion,
and hopefully you don&rsquo;t end up in a gas chamber.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come up this idea myself, but was inspired by Bryan Cantrill&rsquo;s talk &ndash;
<em>Principles of Technology Leadership</em>. TBH, I&rsquo;m still struggling with how values
and principles are different because there seems to be a thin line separating
the two camps. But I at least wholeheartedly agree with what he said
(especially, the famous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xh0ZIEUOE">huslinnnnnn'</a>). You can bring more
of the &ldquo;better angels of our nature&rdquo; of yourself by having your principles
clearly elucidated, and maybe along the way you could be a hypocrite as you
can&rsquo;t hold up to the principles all the time. But hey, aren&rsquo;t lives worth living
this way? At least you can give it a try. Absolutely, not for me, but for your
kids, for your family, then for your coworkers and teams. And you can start now
by watching Bryan&rsquo;s talk.</p>

<h2 id="dont-be-the-police-instead-be-an-artist">Don&rsquo;t be the police. Instead, be an artist.</h2>
<p>After being with the company for more than a while, I believe that the reason we
are where we are has been mainly the police departments of the company. By
definition, all police officers are those who learn protect and serve.  Protect
what?  The answer lies in &ldquo;Law enforcement&rdquo;.  Try to reflect this and see who
they are in your company.</p>
<p>My experience led me to view Internal Auditor and IT Security departments of
most Fortune 500 companies play this role of &ldquo;Law Enforcement&rdquo;.  They are
inherently incentivized to find faults in how others operate.  This is fine and
dandy, like your body need you need white blood cells to weed out malignant
perpetrators. In the same way, Auditors and IT Security are there to protect the
integrity of the operations (&ldquo;Are you really performing as documented?&quot;) or the
holistic security of the company&rsquo;s IT system.</p>
<p>The problem is when they take things too strictly or too literally, and they are
equipped with all the power to do so.  Very often, I hear horror stories about
them and the crux just lies in how these people interpret as transgressions.
Because they&rsquo;re incentivized to find flaws, they&rsquo;re also apt to interpret the
rules so that flaws will emerge.  The utmost failure of auditors or IT security
team would be to have no comment.  Alas, finding something petty or ridiculous
is still better than nothing-to-look-here-everything-is-good.</p>
<p>The result, unfortunately, is it becomes the highest priority of the comment
receivers as well to address these &ldquo;gaps&rdquo;.  The good, valid ones are ok.  But
what about those petty and ridiculous ones?  What I have seen is they add more
toils on top of how the team will have to operate. They twist and turn the limbs
until the team becomes an ugly bonsai tree.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an alternative?  Personally I think the answer lies in the area almost the
opposite of a corporate settings or Science and Technology.  It&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-learn-the-rules-like-a-pro-so-you-can-break-them-like-an-artist-pablo-picasso-48-14-73.jpg" alt="Picasso&rsquo;sQuote"></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix
Project</a>, the
character that people resonate best is John Pesche, who later transforms himself
from a principal-like security officer to a person willing to help others and
even takes certain risks.  To me, it&rsquo;s like he is reborn overnight, instead
of instituting fears and being a showstopper, becoming a person using his knowledge
to say yes because he knows the risks well. Isn&rsquo;t that like knowing the rules so
he breaks them like an artist?  And to me, this is the mindset that would make
DevSecOps work.  The same goes with Auditors.  That mindset would make the work
more interesting instead of dreadful.  Who knows you may have a lot of fun being
a part of something bigger and better than a pesticide.  Like if you can produce
music with good rhythm, I&rsquo;m sure together we will mix well:</p>

<h2 id="diversity-it-begins-with-a-two-way-communication">Diversity?? It begins with a two-way communication!</h2>
<p>Not sure if you have heard these things before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked you to do so. If not, I will have to go to your VP to get you do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;ll become a mandate for these security tools to be in your pipeline.  They
are not doing anything much but we want them to be installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be done, period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moment you hear these words, you can probably deduce that <em>Wow these guys
will not listen, neither will my manager.</em>  That has been my ultimate theory in
the corporate settings about power struggling and these people must have
accumulated quite amount of power and they&rsquo;re turned loose to use it.  I can&rsquo;t
help but to think how similar this is to the famous <a href="https://g.co/kgs/U5aFwZ">Stanford Prison
Experiment</a> where things turned awry and had to be
stopped even before midway of the experiment.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ol1KB-_rIgA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>One thing can be concluded for sure is these people won&rsquo;t listen.  They are not
there to hear your explanation.  And the last thing they want is to see you
challenge their assumptions.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your explanation is or
how flawed their arguments are, once pinpointed and fixated, they have the power
to declare certain things in a certain way.  One of the famous quotes of my
ex-VP was <em>&ldquo;Trust, but verify&rdquo;</em> and boy oh boy these people come to verify hard
with no question can be asked because of the fears being instituted in the past.</p>
<p>Apart from this making me feel angry, if we carefully examining what is not
right about the situation, it&rsquo;d be that the power is unbalanced where one side&rsquo;s
arguments are heavier than the other side. Like how a country falls and when a
civil war erupts, it&rsquo;s mostly because power is not distributed well, or when
justice is not properly given. It&rsquo;s not about politics, but well more of how
people live together, cooperate, collaborate, become united or drifted apart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in any management position, nor am I a leader, but if I could suggest,
it&rsquo;d be that people will have to be tolerant of different opinions and that
should be a foundational habit of an organization. With everything going on, I
just see many try to show how diverse their environments are.  It&rsquo;s mostly like
<em>Look at us! We have people of colors, we have Asians, we have people of
alternative sexual identities.  Hence we have diversity!</em> Wrong! That&rsquo;s merely a
theater and make people turn sour once they know their opinions are not welcome.
It&rsquo;s about tolerance in all senses of one&rsquo;s body, not different sets of RGB
value or genomes.</p>
<p>You can look at this how your relationship is with your children.  I don&rsquo;t know
about you but Asian parents don&rsquo;t like their children to challenge them.  The
downside is that if you treat your people like children, your people behave like
children.  From a security perspective, to survive in a harsher and harsher
cyberspace, don&rsquo;t you want people (or children?) to be strong?  Together, we can be
better but we must be able to respect each other&rsquo;s opinions and learn that we
can be wrong sometimes because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.  &ndash; <strong>Albert
Camus</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So two-way communication and acceptance are a must.  And for egality&rsquo;s sake,
both sides must be able to <em>trust but verify</em> as well.</p>
<h2 id="say-no-to-hero-culture">Say no to Hero culture</h2>
<p>I used to be a kid, naive and immature.  I used to believe in Heroes because&hellip;
why not, right?  They are good people, they protect us.  They fight the bad guys
for us.</p>
<p>The danger of this kind of thinking of mine lies into these simple words of the
previous sentence: <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em>.  Just who defines them in the first place?
Is everything the heroes do are rightfully so?  It&rsquo;s good if we have the same
sense of good and bad.  The problem is that we probably sometimes don&rsquo;t and when
that happens, how the conflicts are resolved.</p>
<p>Corporations are full of heroes. These heroes earned their titles because of
leadership, skills, nobility and maybe perception of the crowd the in past. It&rsquo;s
easy to have affection and even fall in love with them, because they&rsquo;re somebody
you can look up to. That&rsquo;s probably a Halo effect in action, and because of
that, it&rsquo;s hard to challenge them.</p>
<p>Another keyword is also <em>&ldquo;in the past&rdquo;</em>, which may or may not have anything to
do with <strong>now</strong>.  People, especially at the higher up positions, have little
time, hence need to delegate certain decisions to certain people they trust.
It&rsquo;s easier to trust people with a brand than nobody, but is that the right
thing to do?  The difference of the words already make it clear - easier is not
necessarily better.  In practice, when you leave certain decision rights to a
certain person, a hero, you allow the person to define a certain thing or even
become it.  For a hero, it may be justice or they become justice.  For an IT
Security expert, it may be what constitutes security or he can become
security.  For a centralized Agile and DevOps organization, they get to say what
DevOps is and can even monopolize it.</p>
<p>Heroes or experts naturally don&rsquo;t want you to challenge them either (What do you
know about these things?  I know it all!). If they think your team are cowboy
coders, you&rsquo;re doomed either directly by them or indirectly by their comments to
your management.  This can become a vicious cycle and turn an environment more
toxic.  Those who stay would eye for these heroic positions, where those in the
positions would do anything to protect their power and status quo.  Those who
are tired would just leave.  Well, power tends to corrupt, eh?</p>
<p>This is sometimes really hard to see because you&rsquo;re supposed to love these
heroes.  But luckily, the trends these days, especially in the DevOps area are
promoting the opposite - selflessness over heroic individuals.
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/hero-culture-teamwork/">Some</a>
are even denouncing or urging people in the industry to fix a hero culture.</p>
<p>I have a litmus test for this hero culture using a bit of data and statistics
(isn&rsquo;t the trend to be cool these days to say I&rsquo;m data driven :P). If 9 out
of 10, you <strong>trust</strong> a particular person on a particular topic to make a
decision, something is off.  Worse, if that person is even from a
different organization, congratulations you have a hero!  Hopefully, you don&rsquo;t
have too many before they think you&rsquo;re Thanos and it&rsquo;ll become another End Game.</p>

<h1 id="parting-words">Parting words</h1>
<p>As an individual, we want no trouble.  That&rsquo;s understandable.  Likewise, When we
see people on the street start fighting, we don&rsquo;t want to get in between them as
you might become the target instead.  When we see an agent of fear operate, we
look down and mind our own business.</p>
<p>At the same time, as humans, we have the ability to think critically.  We also
have the ability, the freedom to speak out.  One may argue that maybe it&rsquo;s a
luxury think, a privilege to be able to do so.  I don&rsquo;t think so.  As a whole,
if we aim for the better, for us, for the people around us, for the place we
belong to, I think it&rsquo;s the moral goal that we&rsquo;re obliged to pursue.  I believe
that&rsquo;s something the founders carefully thought of and believed in the best of
the people when they wrote their principles and perhaps even the first set of
corporate policies.  Sadly along the way, it&rsquo;s also people who lost sight and
may have turned things sideways.  The moment those who care discovered it, it
may have already been Auschwitz or Nanjing and they may no longer have the power
to correct things.</p>
<p>The future lies in how much people can unite and oppose certain things such as the
use of fears or authoritarians.  It can be hard, because you and your team may
already be divided and conquered, or even about to be.  You can start now by
thinking deeply about things around you, by not simply giving in or by declining
your Corporate Gestapos to achieve their eradicative mission.  That&rsquo;s a noble
thing one can do.</p>

<h4 id="ps-as-were-talking-about-fears">P.S. As we&rsquo;re talking about fears&hellip;</h4>
<p>I wish my American friends the best about their country&rsquo;s position in the
current world. I&rsquo;m not in any position to criticize anything your previous
president<strong>S</strong> said and did in the past (btw see the &lsquo;S&rsquo;, right?).  I&rsquo;m not an
American and don&rsquo;t get me wrong although I&rsquo;m from a Chinese family doesn&rsquo;t mean
that I wish for your downfall..  quite the opposite.  One of the things giving
me a bit of a spine chill is your country&rsquo;s position. If you simplify it like a
game of Go, you know you&rsquo;re in a bad shape when you&rsquo;re heavily surrounded. Try
to rule it out like scientists disproving a theory by seeing how occupying you
are vs the Chinese in the following regions: Africa, Middle East, South East
Asia, or even Europe and Australia. Bob Dylan already said it all and well in
his song:</p>

<p>And I know I very well deserve an MYOB comment.</p>
